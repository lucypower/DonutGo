# DonutGo
 
DonutGo is a tycoon simulator game mobile game which I developed as part of my undergraduate degree. I chose this style of game as it's one of my favourite type of mobile games to play, and I then chose the donut theme because of a donut asset that I had made myself in Blender in the same year.
